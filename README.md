#  Jakarta EE MVC Sample 

As an alternative of Jakarta  Faces which is used to build web UI with components, Jakarta EE MVC spec is similar with the transactional MVC framework, such as Apache Struts,  Spring MVC, etc. which provides capability for building action-based web applications.

In this sample application, we will build a web application with [Jakarta MVC specification](https://www.mvc-spec.org/).  Jakarta MVC is based on the existing  JAX-RS specs, it reuses the JAX-RS APIs, and add some additional APIs   to  the specific *action* features.

[Eclipse Krazo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.krazo) is the  reference implementation of Jakarta MVC, it supports the following JAXRS platforms.

* Jersey (Glassfish/Payara)
* Resteasy( Wildfly)
* Apache CXF( TomEE)
